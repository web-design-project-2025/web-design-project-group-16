          <p id="intro">
            Every year, as the new year begins to take shape, there is always
            one thing you can count on, and that is, awards season. With this
            last year’s film boom, there were quite a few works that were worthy
            competitors for the various awards. The run of red carpets came to
            its close this last Saturday as the Oscar’s took place at the Dolby
            Theatre in Hollywood, LA. What is normally a very classy and well
            directed affair with a star-studded red carpet, a precise manuscript
            and set menu, was something else altogether this year. What even
            happened at the Oscars?
          </p>
          <div id="article">
            <div class="column-1">
              <p>
                The night begun as any oscars eve. Stars arrived to the carpet
                an lined up to have their pictures taken. Reporters were ready
                with their tiny microphones and cameras, the crowd on the other
                side of the street was flocking to catch a glimpse of the
                celbrities. The troubles started when the cast of the latest
                Marvel film adroned the red steps. The film has gained a lot of
                traction due to the drama between the lead actress, Millie Lou,
                and the two male leads Steven Johnsson and Mike King. Lou and
                King are rumored to have had an affair during filming, which
                supposedly made Johnsson very mad, causing a falling out between
                Johnsson and King. When the cast adorned the carpet, an argument
                broke out between King and Johnsson that resulted in both of
                them being removed by security, the two actors were not seen
                during the dinner and were not present during the awards
                ceremony.
              </p>

              <p>
                Moving on from the disaster carpet, stars entered the Dolby
                theatre and started to find their seats. Everyone sat down,
                began their dinner and the cermenoy started. This year’s host,
                Jean Villerunie, who’s harsh opionions on hollywood and actors
                does not go quietly by had the audience somewhat uncomfortable
                in their seats. He opened his monologue by making a few jokes
                based on the celebreties, which had many people laughing.

            <div class="column-2">
              <p>
                But then, Villerunie makes a joke about the recent split between
                hollywoods favorite couple Margret Kane and Brent Sacker. The
                joke made it out to sound like that it was Kane’s fault that
                Sacker left, when it was Sacker who had multiple affairs during
                the marrige. This joke caused a very strong reaction with
                Sacker, who left his seat, went up on stage and punched
                Villerunie in the face. The cermony took a brief intermission
                and Sacker too had to leave the Dolby theatre.
              </p>
              <p>
                One might think this is where the disasters stopped here, but
                no. Villerunie’s face was in such bad shape that he had to leave
                the Dolby theatre to seek medical attention. This left the
                Oscar’s without a host to keep guests entertained between
                awards. Thus the rest of the gala was just akward if you ask
                this reporter. Many of the performances fell flat without the
                comedic tone the that the gala often prompts for. Everyone
                recieved their awards and the ceremony fisnished about 40
                minutes earlier that planned. The nightmare evening that was
                this year’s oscars did however make many of the stars let loose
                during the afterparty, which according to sources was the best
                one since Elton John lit a piano on fire in 1996. In conclusion,
                this year’s oscars was a real lowpoint in the academys almost
                100 year history, granted however it was not at the fault of the
                academy, but rather the drama of grown up men and women. But it
                did prove that a real lowpoint sparks a great afterparty.
